You are a Python programmer in the field of operations research and optimization.

Your proficiency in utilizing third-party libraries such as Gurobi is essential. In addition to your expertise in Gurobi, it would be great if you could also provide some background in related libraries or tools, like NumPy, SciPy, or PuLP. 

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A fishery wants to transport their catch. They can either use local sled dogs or trucks. Local sled dogs and trucks can take different amount of fish per trip. Also, the cost per trip for sled dogs and truck is also differs. You should note that the budget has an upper limit and the number of sled dog trips must be less than the number of truck trips. Formulate an LP to maximize the number of fish that can be transported.

- Make sure that the final optimal objective value is stored in a variable named "obj_val".

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A scientist in the arctic needs to get enough vitamin D and vitamin C in his diet by drinking orange and apple juice. Each box of orange juice contains 10 units of vitamin D and 8 units of vitamin C. Each box of apple juice contains 12 units of vitamin D and 6 units of vitamin C. Since the scientist prefers apple juice, he must drink at least 3 times as many apple juice boxes and orange juice boxes. However, he must also drink at least 3 orange juice boxes. To avoid a vitamin C overdose, the scientist can consume at most 300 units of vitamin C. How many of each juice box should he drink to maximize his total vitamin D intake?

A doctor recommends that a man eat burgers and pizza in order to put on weight. Each burger contains 10 units of fat and 300 calories. Each slice of pizza contains 8 units of fat and 250 calories. The man must get at least 130 units of fat and 3000 calories. Further, each burger contains 12 units of cholesterol while each slice of pizza contains 10 units of cholesterol. Since burgers are slightly more expensive, the man decides to eat at least twice as many slices of pizza as burgers. How many of each should he eat to minimize his cholesterol intake?

A clinic makes batches of vitamin shots and pills. Each batch of vitamin shots requires 30 units of vitamin C and 40 units of vitamin D. Each batch of vitamin pills requires 50 units of vitamin C and 30 units of vitamin D.

The expensive box contains 5 units of metal and 8 units of acid which can be mixed to create 10 units of foam. The cheap box however gives off 2 units of heat while the expensive box gives off 3 units of heat. The science store has available 200 units of metal and 300 units of acid. If at most 50 units of heat can be given off, how many of each box should the store make to maximize the amount of foam produced?

- Make sure that the final optimal objective value is stored in a variable named "obj_val".

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A company make both liquid and foam hand sanitizer. Liquid hand sanitizer requires 40 units of water and 50 units of alcohol. Foam hand sanitizer requires 60 units of water and 40 units of alcohol. The company has available 2000 units of water and 2100 units of alcohol. The number of foam hand sanitizers made must exceed the number of liquid hand sanitizers. In addition, at most 30 liquid hand sanitizers can be made. If each liquid hand sanitizer can clean 30 hands and each foam hand sanitizer can clean 20 hands, how many of each should the company make to maximize the number of hands that can be cleaned?

A cleaning company located in Edmonton wants to get the best exposure possible for promoting their new dishwashing detergent without exceeding their $250,000 advertising budget. To do so, the company decides to spend their money on two forms of advertising: (1) radio ads and (2) social media ads. Each radio ad costs $5,000; each social media ad costs $9,150. The expected exposure, based on industry ratings, is 60,500 viewers for each radio ad. Additionally, the expected exposure for each social media ad is 50,000 viewers. The company decides that at least 15 but no more than 40 radio ads should be ordered, and that at least 35 social media ads should be contracted.

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A popup clinic is doing virus testing with either spit tests or swabs. A spit test takes 10 minutes to administer while a  swab takes 15 minutes to administer. Since the spit test is more accurate, at least twice as many spit tests should be given as  swabs. However, at least 20  swabs must be administers. If the popup clinic operates for 8000 minutes, maximize the number of tests that can be administered.

- Make sure that the final optimal objective value is stored in a variable named "obj_val".

Now the origin problem is as follow:

An international goods exporter uses ships and planes to transport goods. A ship can take 40 containers worth of goods and uses 500 liters of fuel per trip. A plane can take 20 containers worth of goods and uses 300 liters of fuel per trip. The company needs to transport at least 500 containers worth of goods. In addition, there can be at most 10 plane trips made and a minimum of 50% of the trips made must be by ship. How many of each trip should be made to minimize the total amount of fuel consumed?

- Make sure that the final optimal objective value is stored in a variable named "obj_val".

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A meat shop ships their burger patties using refrigerated trucks and vans. Each truck can take 1000 patties at a cost of $300 per trip. Each van can take 500 patties at a cost of $100 per trip. Because the trucks have difficulty moving around in the city, the number of trucks must not exceed the number of vans. The meat shop has to ship at least 50000 patties and they have a budget of $12500. How should they plan their shipment to minimize the total number of trips?

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A meal service company delivers meals to customers either on electric bikes or scooters. A bike can hold 8 meals and requires 3 units of charge. A scooter can hold 5 meals and requires 2 units of charge. Since the city is more friendly towards scooters, at most 30% of the electric vehicles can be bikes and at least 20 scooters must be used. If the company only has 200 units of charge available, how many of each vehicle should be used to maximize the number of meals that can be delivered?

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A mail delivery service in an island village delivers mail by regular and speed boats. A regular boat can carry 20 pieces of mail per trip and uses 10 liters of gas. A speed boat can carry 30 pieces of mail per trip and uses 20 liters of gas. There can be at most 20 regular boat trips. Since customers want their mail as fast as possible, at least 50% of the trips must be made by speed boats.

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A village hosts a banquet and provides bike and car transportation for everyone. A bike can take 3 people while a car can take 5 people. Since cars are more expensive, at most 40% of the vehicles can be cars. If the village needs to transport at least 500 people, how many of each vehicle should be used to minimize the total number of bikes needed?

- Make sure that the final optimal objective value is stored in a variable named "obj_val".

# Create a new model
model = gp.Model("Transportation")

# Decision variables: number of bikes and cars
bikes = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=gp.GRB.INTEGER, name="bikes")

Now the origin problem is as follow:

An industrial tire company delivers large tires for equipment to remote engineering sites either by cargo planes or ultrawide trucks. Each cargo plane can transport 10 tires per trip and costs $1000.

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A factory transports rice to the city in horse-drawn carts that are either medium or large size. A medium sized cart requires 2 horses and can carry 30 kg of rice. A large sized cart requires 4 horses and can carry 70 kg of rice.  The factory has 60 horses available. Because the horses don't get along well, the number of medium sized carts must be three times the number of large sized carts. In addition, there must be at least 5 medium sized carts and at least 5 large sized carts. How many of each cart size should be used to maximize the amount of rice that can be transported?

- Make sure that the final optimal objective value is stored in a variable named "obj_val".

Now the origin problem is as follow:

An artisan makes two types of terracotta jars: a thin jar and a stubby jar. Each thin jar requires 50 minutes of shaping time and 90 minutes of baking time. Each stubby jar requires 30 minutes of shaping time and 150 minutes of baking time. Per week, there are 3000 minutes available for shaping and 4000 minutes available for baking. The profit per thin jar is $5 and the profit per stubby jar is $9. How many jars of each type should the artisan make to maximize profit?

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A meat processing plant uses two machines, a meat slicer and a meat packer, to make their hams and pork ribs. To produce one batch of hams requires 4 hours on the meat slicer and 2.5 hours on the meat packer. To produce one batch of pork ribs requires 2 hours on the meat slicer and 3.5 hours on the meat packer. Each machine runs for at most 4000 hours per year. If the profit per batch of hams is $150 and the profit per batch of pork ribs is $300, how many batches of each should be made to maximize profit?

- Make sure that the final optimal objective value is stored in a variable named "obj_val".

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A food company would like to run its commercials on three streaming platforms: Pi TV, Beta Video and Gamma Live. The cost for a commercial as well as the expected audience reach is given. On Pi TV, a commercial costs $1200 and attracts 2000 viewers. On Beta Video, a commercial costs $2000 and attracts 5000 viewers. On Gamma Live, a commercial costs $4000 and attracts 9000 viewers. Beta Video limits the number of commercials from a single company to 8. In order to attract a wide range of people, at most a third of all commercials should occur on Gamma Live and a minimum of 20% should occur on Pi TV. If the weekly budget is $20000, how many commercials should be run in each of the three possible choices in order to maximize audience?

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A dentist has 3000 units of resin to fill cavities in both molars and canines. Molars require 20 units of resin and 3 units of pain killer. Canines require 15 units of resin and 2.3 units of pain killer. Since this dentist sees more cavities in canines, at least 60% of cavities filled must be in canines. In addition, the dentist must reserve materials to fill at least 45 molars. How many of each type of teeth should the dentist schedule to fill to minimize the amount of pain killer needed?

Your proficiency in utilizing third-party libraries such as Gurobi is essential. In addition to your expertise in Gurobi, it would be great if you could also provide some background in related libraries or tools, like NumPy, SciPy, or PuLP. 

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A dim sum restaurant can deliver their food by cart or by hand. Servers can deliver by cart and have 70 customer interactions and will have to refill food five times an hour. They can also deliver more food by hand, due to the increased mobility, and have 85 customer interactions while refilling food twenty times an hour. However, the customers get more options when delivering by cart, therefore at least 70% of delivery shifts must be by cart. There must be at least 3 servers delivering by hand for their direct customer service. If the restaurant wants to have 4000 customer interactions per hour, how many of each form of delivery should the dim sum restaurant schedule to minimize the total number of refills per hour?

Now the origin problem is as follow:

An autobody shop needs to purchase two types of car jacks, an automatic electric one, or a gas-powered one. The automatic electric one can process 5 cars every hour and uses 6 units of electricity whereas the gas-powered one can process 4 cars each hour using 7 units of gas. Since there is a limit to how many automatic electric ones there can be due to the limited number of power outlets, the shop must use less than 15 automatic electric ones. The shop can use at most 50 units of electricity and 80 units of gas. How many of each type of jack should the shop purchase to maximize the amount of cars processed every hour?

You are a Python programmer in the field of operations research and optimization.

Your proficiency in utilizing third-party libraries such as Gurobi is essential. In addition to your expertise in Gurobi, it would be great if you could also provide some background in related libraries or tools, like NumPy, SciPy, or PuLP. 

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A hospital prepares batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams. Each medication patch requires 3 minutes to prepare and 5 units of materials. Each anti-biotic cream requires 5 minutes to prepare and 6 units of materials. Since anti-biotic creams are used more often, there must be at least twice as many anti-biotic creams as medication patches. Due to storage reasons, the hospital can make at most 100 batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams in total. The hospital has available 400 minutes of staff to spare and 530 units of materials. If each batch of medication patches can treat 3 people and each batch of anti-biotic cream can treat 2 people, how many batches of each should be made to maximize the number of people that can be treated?

- Make sure that the final optimal objective value is stored in a variable named "obj_val".

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A gem factory has two drills, a high intensity one and a low intensity one. Each day, the high intensity drill can process 50 gems and requires 50 units of water to dissipate heat. Each day, the low intensity drill can process 30 gems and requires 20 units of water to dissipate heat. Each day the factory must process 800 gems and they have available 700 units of water. Since the high intensity drill produces a lot of noise pollution, at most 40% of the drills can be high intensity ones. Further, at least 10 should be low intensity drills.

You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem. 

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A post office is buying stamping machines and they can buy a dual or single model stamping machine. A dual model stamping machine can stamp 50 letters per minute while a single model stamping machine can stamp 30 letters per minute. The dual model stamping machine requires 20 units of glue per minute while the single model stamping machine requires 15 units of glue per minute. Since the single model stamping machine is quieter, the number of single model stamping machines must be more than the number of dual model stamping machines. Further, the post office wants to make sure they can stamp at least 300 letters per minute and use at most 135 units of glue per minute. How many of each stamping machine should they purchase to minimize the total number of stamping machines?

Now the origin problem is as follow:

An Indian restaurant makes goat and chicken curry. Each bowl of goat curry requires 3 units of goat meat and 6 units of the curry base. Each bowl of chicken curry requires 5 units of chicken meat and 5 units of the curry base. The restaurant has available 1500 units of goat meat and 2000 units of chicken meat. At least 25% of the bowls made must be chicken curry. Since goat curry is more popular, the number of goat curry bowls must be larger than the number of chicken curry bowls. How many of each type of curry bowl should be made to minimize the total amount of curry base used?

Now the origin problem is as follow:

A mining company has available a total of 100 square miles of mining sites and considering the use of two mining techniques: heap leaching and vat leaching. For each square mile of land, heap leaching technique can have a daily production of 3 tons of rare earth oxide per square miles but it also creates 8 tons of polluted wastewater and requires 10 extraction machines. On the other hand, vat leaching technique produces 5 tons of rare earth oxide per square miles per day while creating 17 tons of polluted wastewater and requiring 20 extraction machines. There are 100 machines available and due to environmental regulations, the amount of polluted wastewater must be at most 90 tons daily.
