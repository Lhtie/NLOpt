An artisan makes two types of terracotta jars: a thin jar and a stubby jar. Each thin jar requires 50 minutes of shaping time and 90 minutes of baking time. Each stubby jar requires 30 minutes of shaping time and 150 minutes of baking time. Per week, there are 3000 minutes available for shaping and 4000 minutes available for baking. The profit per thin jar is $5 and the profit per stubby jar is $9. How many jars of each type should the artisan make to maximize profit?
