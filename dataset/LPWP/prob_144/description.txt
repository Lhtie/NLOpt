Both chorine and water softener need to be added to a pool. One unit of chlorine takes 1 minute to be effective while one unit of water softener takes 2 minutes to be effective. Because too much chlorine can burn your eyes, there has to at most half as much chlorine as water softener in the pool. If there has to be at least 200 units of chlorine in the water and a total of 500 units of chemicals in the water, how many units of each should be added to minimize the total time it takes for the pool to be ready? (Note: chlorine must be added before water softener or vice versa).
