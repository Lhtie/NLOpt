A biotechnology company has 35,000 units of antibiotics available which is important to the process of making a first-dose and second-dose of vaccines. The first-dose vaccine requires 30 units of antibiotics and 20 mg of gelatine whereas the second-dose vaccine requires 65 units of antibiotics and 60 mg of gelatine. Since the first-dose vaccine is required before the second-dose vaccine, there must be more first-dose than second-dose vaccines manufactured. However, at least 40 second-dose vaccines must be made. How many of each vaccine should be made to minimize the amount of gelatine used?
