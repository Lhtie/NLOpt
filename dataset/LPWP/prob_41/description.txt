A flooring company produces engineered hardwood and vinyl planks. Their sales forecasts show an expected demand of at least 20,000 square foot of hardwood and 10,000 square feet of vinyl planks each week. To satisfy a shipping contract, a total of at least 60,000 square feet of flooring much be shipped each week. Due to a labor shortage issue, no more than 50,000 square feet of hardwood and 30,000  square feet of vinyl  can be produced weekly. If a square foot of hardwood flooring yields a profit of $2.5 and a square foot of vinyl planks produces a $3 profit, how many of each type of flooring should be made weekly to maximize the company's profit?
