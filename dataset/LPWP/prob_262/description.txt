Due to an accident, at least 550 locals must be moved across a lake. They can either be transported over the lake by a kayak or a motorboat. Kayaks can transport 4 people every trip and motorboats can transport 5 people every trip. Kayaks take 5 minutes per trip whereas motorboats take 3 minutes per trip. Due to the limited number of motorboats available to the locals, there can be at most 25 motorboat trips and at least 75% of the trips should be by kayak. How many of each transportation method should be used to minimize the total amount of time needed to transport all the locals?
