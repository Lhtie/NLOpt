A hospital purchases two pills available for the patients to take one at a time. One pill is taken as a prevention and another is taken for treatment. The prevention pill takes 15 dollars to make while the treatment pill takes 25 dollars to make. Since the prevention pill is in higher demand, the hospital must purchase at least two times as many prevention pills as treatment pills. In addition, the hospital must purchase at least 50 treatment pills. If the clinic only has a budget of 10000 dollars, maximize the number of patients that can be treated.
