A theme park transports its visitors around the park either by scooter or rickshaw. A scooter can carry 2 people while a rickshaw can carry 3 people. To avoid excessive pollution, at most 40% of the vehicles used can be rickshaws. If the park needs to transport at least 300 visitors, minimize the total number of scooters used.
