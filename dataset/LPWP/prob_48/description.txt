A teddy bear company produces three different colored bears: black, white, and brown. These bears are made in two different factories. Running factory 1 for 1 hour costs $300 and produces 5 black teddy bears, 6 white teddy bears, and 3 brown ones. Running factory 2 for 1 hour costs $600 and produces 10 black teddy bears and 10 white teddy bears. (but no brown ones). To meet children's demand, at least 20 black teddy bears, 5 white teddy bears, and 15 brown teddy bears must be made daily. Given this information, develop a linear programming problem assuming the teddy bear company wants to minimize the cost of production.
