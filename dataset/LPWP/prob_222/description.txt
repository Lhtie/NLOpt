Zeta Bakery sells two types of cookies. They sell a strawberry cookie and a sugar cookie. Let's say they make x1 strawberry cookies, at a profit of $5.5 each, and x2 sugar cookies, at a profit of $12 each (x1 and x2 are unknowns both greater than or equal to 0). The daily demand for these cookies is at most 100 strawberry cookies and at most 80 sugar cookies. The bakery is short staffed and can make a maximum of 100 cookies of either type per day. How much of each cookie should the bakery make in order to maximize profit?
