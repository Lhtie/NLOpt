A doctor recommends her patient eat more fish and chicken to increase her protein and iron intake. Each fish meal contains 10 units of protein and 12 units of iron. Each chicken meal contains 15 units of protein and 8 units of iron. The patient needs to consume at least 130 units of protein and 120 units of iron. Since the chicken meal is less expensive, the patient prefers to consume at least twice as many chicken meals as fish meals. If each fish meal contains 7 units of fat and each chicken meal contains 10 units of fat, how many meals of each should she eat to minimize her fat intake?
