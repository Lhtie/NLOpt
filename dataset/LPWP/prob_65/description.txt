An oil and gas company operates on 300 acres of land where they use oil wells of small and large size. Per acre of land, a small oil well can produce 2 barrels of oil. Per acre of land, a large oil well can produce 5 barrels of oil. However, a small oil well produces 10 units of pollution and requires 5 drill bits per acre and a large oil well produces 20 units of pollution and requires 10 drill bits per acre. The company has available 2500 drill bits and due to strict environmental laws can produce at most 4500 units of pollution. For how many acres should each oil well be used to maximize the total production of oil?
