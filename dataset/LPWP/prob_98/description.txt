A vine company sells vine in vintage and regular bottles. A vintage bottle can hold 500 ml of vine while a regular bottle can hold 750 ml of vine. The company has available 100000 ml of vine. Because vintage bottles are mostly bought by collectors, the number of regular bottles must be at least 4 times as much as the number of vintage bottles. However, at least 10 vintage bottles must be made. How many of each should be made to maximize the total number of bottles produced?
