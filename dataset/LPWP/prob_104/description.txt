A scientist in the arctic needs to get enough vitamin D and vitamin C in his diet by drinking orange and apple juice. Each box of orange juice contains 10 units of vitamin D and 8 units of vitamin C. Each box of apple juice contains 12 units of vitamin D and 6 units of vitamin C. Since the scientist prefers apple juice, he must drink at least 3 times as many apple juice boxes and orange juice boxes. However, he must also drink at least 3 orange juice boxes. To avoid a vitamin C overdose, the scientist can consume at most 300 units of vitamin C. How many of each juice box should he drink to maximize his total vitamin D intake?
