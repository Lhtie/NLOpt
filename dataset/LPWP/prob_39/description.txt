An ice cream store makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream by the gallon. In a week, they must make at least 5 gallons of each type but at most 10 gallons of chocolate ice cream and at most 8 gallons of vanilla ice cream. It takes 1 hour to produce a gallon of chocolate ice cream and 2 hours to produce a gallon of vanilla ice cream. In a week, 30 hours are available to make ice cream. In addition at least 6 workers are needed with 1 working on the chocolate ice cream and 2 on the vanilla ice cream at any time. If the profit per gallon of chocolate ice cream is $200 and the profit per gallon of vanilla ice cream is $300, how many gallons of each should be made to maximize profit?
