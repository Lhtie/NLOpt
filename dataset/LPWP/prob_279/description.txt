A dessert shop is popular for their only two desserts - matcha ice cream and orange sorbet. Two units of flavouring and four units of ice cream is required to make one order of matcha ice cream. Four units of flavouring and three units of water is required to make an order of orange sorbet. The dessert shop has recently been getting more orders online for orange sorbet and therefore, there should be more orange sorbet made than matcha ice cream. However, at least fifteen percent of desserts made must be matcha ice cream. The dessert shop has available 600 units of ice cream and 550 units of water. How many of each dessert should the shop make to minimize the total amount of flavouring needed?
