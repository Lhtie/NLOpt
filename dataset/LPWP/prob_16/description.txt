A company is deciding where to promote their product. Some options include z-tube, soorchle engine, and wassa advertisements. The cost for each option and the number of viewers they each attract is given. On z-tube, each ad costs $1000 and attracts 400,000 viewers. On soorchle, each ad costs $200 and attracts 5,000 viewers. On wassa, each ad costs $100 and attracts 3,000 viewers. Soorchle limits the number of advertisements from a single company to fifteen. Moreover, in order to balance the advertising among the three types of media, at most a third of the total number of advertisements should occur on wassa. And at least 5% should occur on z-tube. The weekly advertising budget is $10000. How many advertisements should be run in each of the three types of media to maximize the total audience?
