A bakery uses a stand-mixer and a slow bake oven to make bread and cookies. Each machine can run for at most 3000 hours per year. To bake a loaf of bread takes 1 hour in the stand mixer and 3 hours in the oven. A batch of cookies requires 0.5 hours in the mixer and 1 hour in the oven. The profit per loaf of bread is $5 and the profit per batch of cookies is $3. How should the bakery operate to maximize total profit?
