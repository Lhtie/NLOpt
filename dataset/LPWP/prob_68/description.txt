A cough syrup company sells cough syrup in kids and adult size bottles. A kids size bottle can hold 100 ml of cough syrup while an adult size bottle can hold 300 ml of cough syrup. Since there is no difference in concentration of medical ingredients between the two bottles, at least 3 times as many adult size bottle must be made as kids size bottles. However, at least 50 kids size bottles must be made. If the company has 25000 ml of cough syrup available, how many bottles of each should be made to maximize the total number of bottles?
