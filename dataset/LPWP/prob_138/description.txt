A university research lab can make two types of diabetes medicine, medicine A and medicine B. Per dose, medicine A takes 30 units of imported material and 50 units of mRNA to make. Per dose, medicine B takes 40 units of imported material and 30 units of mRNA to take. The lab has available at most 300 units of imported material and 400 units of mRNA. The lab can make at most 5 doses of medicine A and the number of doses of medicine B must be larger than the number of dosed of medicine A. If one dose of medicine A can treat 12 people and one dose of medicine B can treat 8 people, how many doses of each should be made to maximize the number of people that can be treated?
