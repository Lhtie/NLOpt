A researcher is outsourcing annotations and has two options: a specialized third-party or a common third-party annotation company. The specialized company can annotate at a rate of 60 images per hour whereas the common company can annotate at a rate of 40 images per hour. However, the specialized company charges $100 per hour and the common company charges $72 per hour. The researcher has deadlines to meet and must complete a dataset of at least 10,000 images. They also have some special images that only the specialized company can annotate. Therefore, at least a third of work must be allocated to the specialized company. How should the researcher distribute the annotations to the two companies to minimize the cost of annotating the whole dataset?
