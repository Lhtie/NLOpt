A daycare center has children they must pick up and can use two types of vehicles: bus or a personal car. A bus can carry 9 children while a personal car can carry 4 children. The daycare has to pick up at least 100 children. Additionally, due to limitations of pollution, there must be more buses than personal cars. But some children require extra attention. Therefore, there must be at least 5 personal cars. How many of each form of transportation should the daycare center schedule for to minimize the total number of vehicles?
