An office supply company makes two types of printers: color printers and black and white printers. Different sections of the factory with different teams produce each printer. The color printer team can produce at most 20 color printers per day while the black and white printer team can produce at most 30 black and white printers per day. Both teams require use of the same paper tray installing machine and this machine can make at most 35 printers of either type each day. Color printers generate a profit of $200 per printer while black and white printers generate a profit of $70 per printer. How many of each printer should be made to maximize the company's profit?
