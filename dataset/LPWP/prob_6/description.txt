A farmer has 140 hectares available to grow tomatoes and potatoes. She prefers to plant more tomatoes than potatoes, but the soil and weather conditions allow her to grow at most twice the amount of tomatoes to that of potatoes. In addition, she must grow at least 20 hectares of tomatoes and at least 30 hectares of potatoes to meet community demands. If the profit per hectare of tomatoes is $350 and the profit per hectare of potatoes is $600, how many hectares of each crop should she plant to maximize profit? What is this profit?
