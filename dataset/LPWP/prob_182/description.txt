The weather is freezing and the fish in the pond need to be transported either by helicopter or car. A helicopter can take 30 fish per trip and takes 40 minutes. A car can take 20 fish per trip and takes 30 minutes. Since helicopter trips are expensive, there can be at most 5 helicopter trips. In addition, at least 60% of the trips should be by car. If at least 300 fish need to transported, how many of each trip should be taken to minimize the total time needed?
