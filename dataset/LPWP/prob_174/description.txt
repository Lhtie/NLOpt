A recycling company collects recycling from neighborhoods using small and large bins. A small bin requires 2 workers while a large bin requires 5 workers. A small bin can hold 25 units of recycling material and a large bin can hold 60 units of recycling material. The company has available 100 workers. Because most people don't recycle, the number of small bins must be three times the number of large bins. In addition, there must be at least 10 small bins and 4 large bins. How many of each bin type should be used to maximize the total amount of recycling material that can be collected?
