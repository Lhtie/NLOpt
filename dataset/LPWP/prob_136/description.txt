A pharmaceutical company has two labs, lab 1 and lab 2, where they make heart and lung medication in pill form. At lab 1, they can produce 20 heart medication pills and 30 lung medication pills per hour. At lab 2, they can produce 30 heart medication pills and 40 lung medication pills per hour. Each session at lab 1 requires 3 hours of worker labor while each session at lab 2 requires 5 hours of worker labor. The company has 1500 worker hours available and must make at least 20000 heart medication pills and at least 30000 lung medication pills. How many hours at each lab should be run to minimize the total time needed?
