A doctor's office takes the  temperature of patients one by one either by using an electronic or regular thermometer. The electronic thermometer takes 3 minutes to make a reading while the regular thermometer takes 2 minutes to make a reading. Since the electronic thermometer is more accurate, at least twice as many patients should have their temperature checked by the electronic thermometer than the regular thermometer. Since the electronic thermometer has a cooldown time, at least 50 patients should have their temperature checked by a regular thermometer. If the office is open for 15000 minutes, maximize the number of patients whose temperature can be taken?
