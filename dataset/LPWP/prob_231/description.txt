An amusement park has two types of games: throwing and climbing games. Throwing games attract 15 customers every hour and climbing games attract 8 customers every hour. Throwing games costs the amusement park $2 in prizes per hour whereas climbing games cost $3 in prizes per hour. Since throwing games yield the most profit, there must be at least twice as many throwing games as climbing games. However, at least 5 games must be climbing. If the amusement park can have at most $100 in prizes every hour, maximize the total number of customers attracted every hour.
