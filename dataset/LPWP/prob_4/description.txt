A lighting company makes desk-lamps and night-lamps. There is an expected demand of at least 30 desk-lamps and 50 night-lamps each day. However, due to the size of their factory, they can make at most 150 desk-lamps and 180 night-lamps per day. To satisfy a contract, a minimum of 100 lamps must be made each day. If the profit per desk-lamp sold is $5 and the profit per night-lamp sold is $8, how many lamps of each type should be made to maximize profit?
