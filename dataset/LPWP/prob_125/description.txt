A patient takes anxiety medication and anti-depressants one after the other. Each unit of anxiety medication takes 3 minutes to be effective while each unit of anti-depressant takes 5 minutes to be effective. The patient must take at least 100 units of medication and at least 30 should be anxiety medication. Since the anxiety medication is strong, the patient can take at most twice the amount of anxiety medication as anti-depressants. How many units of each should the patient take to minimize the total time it take for the medication to be effective?
