A bee farmer transports his honey in small and large bottles. A small bottle can take 5 units of honey while a large bottle can take 20 units of honey. The farmer has available at most 300 small bottles and at most 100 large bottles. In addition, since small bottles are easier to sell, at least twice as many small bottles must be used than large bottles. Finally, he can transport at most 200 bottles total and at least 50 must be large bottles. How many of each bottle should be use to maximize the total amount of honey he can transport?
