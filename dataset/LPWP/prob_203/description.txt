A milk tea shop owner would like to sell two different milk teas: black milk tea and matcha milk tea. Each contains both milk and honey. A bottle of black milk tea contains 600 grams of milk and 10 grams of honey, whereas a bottle of matcha milk tea contains 525 grams of milk and 5 grams of honey. The profit from each bottle of black milk tea sold is $7.5 and the profit from each bottle of matcha milk tea sold is $5. If his total production must not exceed his available stock of 30000 grams of milk and 500 grams of honey, how many bottles of each type of milk tea should be made to maximize profits?
