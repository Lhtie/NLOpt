A restaurant has two combos available to their customers, an original and an experimental meal. The original meal typically generates 20 units of food waste and 45 units of wrapping waste and takes 10 minutes to cook. In comparison, the experimental meal generates 25 units of food waste and 35 units of wrapping waste and takes 15 minutes to cook. The restaurant can have at most 900 units of wrapping waste and can have at most 800 units of food waste as regulated by the government. How many of each combo should be pushed for by the waiting staff to minimize the cooking time?
