A farmer has 500 acres of land to grow turnips and pumpkins. Turnips require 50 minutes of watering and $80 worth of pesticide per acre. Pumpkins require 90 minutes of watering and $50 worth of pesticide per acre. The farmer has 40000 minutes available for watering and $34000 available to spend on pesticide. If the revenue per acre of turnips is $300 and the revenue per acre of pumpkins is $450, how many acres of each should he grow to maximize his revenue.
