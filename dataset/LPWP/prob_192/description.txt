There has been a horrible accident and patients need to be taken to the hospital by either a helicopter or bus. A helicopter can transport 5 patients per trip and takes 1 hour. On the other hand, a bus can transport 8 patients per trip and takes 3 hours. At least 120 patients need to be transported and at least 30% of the trips should be by helicopter. In addition, there can be at most 10 bus trips. How should the patients be taken to minimize the total time to transport the patients?
