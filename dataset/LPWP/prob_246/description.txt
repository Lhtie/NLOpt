A lighting company has access to two types of lights to provide their customers, an LED fixture, and a fluorescence lamp. The LED light uses 5 units of electricity per hour and needs to be changed 3 times a decade. Conversely, the fluorescence lamp uses 8 units of electricity per hour and needs to be changed 4 times a decade. Due to previous installations, at least 30% implemented lights must be fluorescence lamps. If the customer requires at least 300 light fixtures and can use at most 2000 units of electricity, how many of each light should be installed to reduce the total number of light changes?
