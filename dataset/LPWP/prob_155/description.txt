An aquarium does shows using otters and dolphins. An otter will do 3 tricks at a time and requires 3 treats to do so. A dolphin will do 1 trick at a time and requires 5 treats to do so. Since dolphins are more popular, at least 10 dolphins must be used and at most 30% of the performers can be otters. If the aquarium only has 200 treats available, maximize the total number of tricks that can be preformed.
