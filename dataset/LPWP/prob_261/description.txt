A taxi company will purchase vehicles to rent to their drivers. They are interested in purchasing either motorcycles or sedans. A motorcycle can transport 30 people, produces 4 units of pollution, and earns the taxi company $100 per shift. A sedan can transport 70 people, produces 15 units of pollution and earns the company $225 per shift. Because not every customer is comfortable with a motorcycle, at most 25% of vehicles can be motorcycles. Additionally, the company has committed to producing less than 200 units of pollution. The company needs to transport at least 1200 people every shift. How many of each type of vehicle should be used to maximize the total earnings for the taxi company per shift?
