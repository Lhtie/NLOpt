A grilled cheese shop sells a light and heavy grilled cheese sandwich. A light grilled cheese sandwich requires 2 slices of bread and 3 slices of cheese. A heavy grilled cheese sandwich requires 3 slices of bread and 5 slices of cheese. Since most people who come to the store love grilled cheese, the store must make at least 3 times as many heavy grilled cheese sandwiches as light grilled cheese sandwiches. The store has available 300 slices of bread and 500 slices of cheese. If a light grilled cheese sandwich takes 10 minutes to make and a heavy grilled cheese sandwich takes 15 minutes to make, how many of each should they make to minimize the total production time?
