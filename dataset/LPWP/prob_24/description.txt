An art store makes large and small art pieces. The store has available 100 units of paint, 50 units of glitter, and 70 units of glue. To make a large art piece requires 4 units of paint, 3 units of glitter, and 5 units of glue. To make a small art piece requires 2 units of paint, 1 unit of glitter, and 2 units of glue. The store must make at least 5 units of each large and small art pieces. If the profit per large art piece is $30 and the profit per small art piece is $15, how many of each should be made to maximize profit?
