A boy needs to get enough magnesium and zinc in his diet by eating chewable gummies and taking pills. Each gummy contains 3 units of magnesium and 4 units of zinc. Each pill contains 2 units of magnesium and 5 units of zinc. The boy must take at least 10 pills. Since he prefers gummies more, he must eat at least 3 times the amount of gummies as pills. If the boy can consume at most 200 units of magnesium, how many of each should he eat to maximize his zinc intake?
