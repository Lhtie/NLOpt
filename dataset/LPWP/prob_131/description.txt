A zookeeper feeds a gorilla with bananas and mangoes. Each banana contains 80 calories, 20 grams of potassium, and 10 grams of sugar. Each mango contains 100 calories, 15 grams of potassium, and 8 grams of sugar.  The gorilla must consume at least 4000 calories and 150 grams of potassium. Since the gorilla prefers bananas, at most 33% of the fruits he eats can be mangoes. If excess sugar makes the gorilla aggressive, how many of each fruit should he consume to minimize his sugar intake?
