In a science club, there are two tables that can be set up to make slime. At table 1, 3 units of powder and 5 units of glue are used to make 4 units of slime. At table 2, 8 units of powder and 6 units of glue are used to make 5 units of slime. However, table 1 produces 2 units of mess while table 2 produces 4 units of mess. The science club has available 100 units of powder and 90 units of glue.  If at most 30 units of mess can be made, how many of each table should be set up to maximize the amount of slime produced?
