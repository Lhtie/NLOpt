The government is reworking the pipes to transport water to houses in the area. The water can be transported through wide pipes or narrow pipes. Wide pipes can transport 25 units of water per minute and narrow pipes can transport 15 units of water per minute. Due to logistics, the number of wide pipes can be at most a third the number of narrow pipes. If there needs to be at least 900 units of water transported every minute, and at least 5 wide pipes must be used, minimize the total number of pipes required.
