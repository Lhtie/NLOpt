A farmer on an island sends corn to the main land either by ferry or light rail. Each ferry trip can take 20 boxes of corn while each light rail trip can take 15 boxes of corn. Since ferry trips are slow, the number of light rail trip has to be at least 4 times the number of ferry trips. If the farmer wants to send at least 500 boxes of corn, minimize the total number of trips of either type needed.
