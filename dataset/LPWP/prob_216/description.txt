A small bakery has 20000 grams of batter and 14000 grams of milk to make their crepe cakes, sponge cakes, and birthday cakes. A crepe cake needs 400 grams of batter and 200 grams of milk. A sponge cake requires 500 grams of batter and 300 grams of milk. A birthday cake requires 450 grams of batter and 350 grams of milk. If the profit per crepe cake is $12, the profit per sponge cake is $10, and the profit per birthday cake is $15, how many of each should the bakery make to maximize their profit?
