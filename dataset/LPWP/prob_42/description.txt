A berry farmer has two farms, an old and new farm, where he grows raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries. He has a contract to provide a local store with 10 kg of raspberries, 9 kg of blueberries, and 15 kg of strawberries. At his old farm, it cost $300 to operate per day and he can harvest and deliver 2 kg of raspberries, 2 kg of blueberries, and 4 kg of strawberries in a day. At his new farm, it costs $200 to operate per day and he can harvest and deliver 4 kg of raspberries, 1 kg of blueberries, and 2 kg of strawberries in a day. Formulate a LP to meet his contract while minimizing his cost.
