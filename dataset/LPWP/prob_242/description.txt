A macro-counting fitness guru only eats salmon and eggs. Each bowl of salmon contains 300 calories, 15 grams of protein, and 80 mg of sodium. Each bowl of eggs contains 200 calories, 8 grams of protein, and 20 mg of sodium. Since the fitness guru has a limit to how many eggs he would like to eat, at most 40% of his meals can be eggs. The fitness guru needs to eat at least 2000 calories and 90 grams of protein. How many of each type of meal should he eat to minimize his sodium intake?
