A farmer has 200 acres of land on which he must process hay using either a windrower or hay harvester. For each acre of land, the windrower can process 10 kg of hay while the hay harvester can process 8 kg of hay. Per acre, the windrower produces 5 kg of methane gas and requires 2 kg of fuel. On the other hand, the hay harvester produces 3 kg of methane gas per acre and requires 1 kg of fuel. There are 300 kg of fuel available and the farmer can produce at most 800 kg of methane gas. For how many acres should each machine be used to maximize the amount of hay processed?
