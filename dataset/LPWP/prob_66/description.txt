A bakery makes almond and pistachio croissants. An almond croissant requires 5 units of butter and 8 units of flour. A pistachio croissant requires 3 units of butter and 6 units of flour. The bakery has available 600 units of butter and 800 units of flour. Since the almond croissant is more popular, at least 3 times as many almond croissants should be made as pistachio croissants. If making an almond croissant takes 12 minutes and making a pistachio croissant takes 10 minutes, how many of each should be made to minimize the total production time?
