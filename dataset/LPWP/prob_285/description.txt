A park is designing their trails and can either create a wide trail or a narrow trail. A wide trail can take 50 visitors every day while the narrow trail expects 20 visitors every day. The wide trail will introduce 6 units of garbage and the narrow trail will introduce 3 units of garbage. There can be at most 3 wide trails and the park hopes to have at most 225 visitors every day. How many of each type of trail should the park construct to minimize the total amount of garbage produced.
