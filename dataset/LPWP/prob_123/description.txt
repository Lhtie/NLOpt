A pharmacy has 3000 mg of morphine to make painkillers and sleeping pills. Each painkiller pill requires 10 mg of morphine and 3 units of digestive medicine. Each sleeping pill requires 6 mg of morphine and 5 units of digestive medicine. The pharmacy needs to make at least 50 painkiller pills. Since sleeping pills are more popular, at least 70% of the pills should be sleeping pills. How many of each should the pharmacy make to minimize the total amount of digestive medicine needed?
