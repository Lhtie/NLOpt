A sailor can eat either a crab cakes or a lobster roll for his meals. He needs to ensure he gets at least 80 units of vitamin A and 100 units of vitamin C. Each crab cake contains 5 units of vitamin A and 7 units of vitamin C. Each lobster roll contains 8 units of vitamin A and 4 units of vitamin C. In addition, since lobster is more expensive, at most 40% of his meals should be lobster rolls. If each crab cake contains 4 units of unsaturated fat and each lobster roll contains 6 units of unsaturated fat, how many of each should he eat to minimize his unsaturated fat intake?
