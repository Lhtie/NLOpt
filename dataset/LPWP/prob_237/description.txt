A singer has two types of concerts he can hold, pop and R&B. Each pop concert will bring in 100 audience members and take 2 days of practice. Every R&B concert brings in 240 audience members and takes 4 days of practice. The singer must bring in at least 10000 audience members and only has available 180 days for practice. If he can at most perform 40% of his concerts as R&B because he likes pop songs more, how many of each type of concert should be created to minimize the total number of concerts?
