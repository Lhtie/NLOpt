Mark has 50 acres of land available to grow potatoes and cucumbers that he sells at a farmers' market. He must grow at least 12 acres of potatoes and 15 acres of cucumbers to meet his contract. Mark prefers to grow more cucumbers than potatoes, but he only has enough resources to grow at most twice the amount of cucumbers as potatoes. If the profit per acre of potatoes is $500 and the profit per acre of cucumbers is $650, how many acres of each should he grow to maximize his profit? What is that profit?
