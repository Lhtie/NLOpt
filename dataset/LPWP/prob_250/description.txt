A soda company sells soda in two types of containers: cans and glass bottles. A can holds 250 ml of soda whereas a bottle holds 1000 ml of soda. The soda company needs to bottle at least 1000000 ml of soda every day and due to the ability to sell soda cans as packs, there must be at least three times more cans than glass bottles. However, because of previous contracts with gas stations, there must be at least 100 glass bottles made. How many of each should be made to maximize the total number of units produced?
