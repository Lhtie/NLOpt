An accounting firm has senior accountants earning $3000 per week and junior accountants earning $1000 per week. The contracts with companies to provide accounting services require at least 100 accountants, of whom at least 5 must be senior accountants. To make sure there is enough experience on the accounting team, the number of senior accountants should be at least a third of the number to junior accountants. The firm wants to keep the weekly wage bill below $150000. Formulate an LP to minimize the wage bill.
